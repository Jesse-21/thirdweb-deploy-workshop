## NFT Staking App

Deployed a simple [NFT staking contract](https://github.com/andreitoma8/ERC721-Staking/blob/master/contracts/ERC721Staking.sol) using [thirdweb deploy](https://blog.thirdweb.com/thirdweb-deploy) to build a simple dapp that allows you to stake NFTs from a collection that will passively generate ERC20 tokens for you.

## Getting Started

First, intall the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `pages/index.tsx`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
